# TODO
- start from scratch and don't write spaghetti code!
- add worked time to project manually
- function to return time worked between two time stamps
- show projects which are not in projects.txt but in main_data.csv in a new section. Maybe greyed out but still functional.
- total time --> new time variable that stops time when any project is running
- implement a sound when a project reached 100%
- plot bars color according to percentage color (red to green)
- sort main_data.csv correctly
- optimize (shorten) read function for projects, goals and reversed colors
- make console uncloseable until quit
- write new goal to projects.txt
- option for no goal
- write to temp_data immediately after starting a timer to prevent dataloss
- add comments!
